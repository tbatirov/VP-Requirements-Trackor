# Requirements-package
Requirements package

Support services, system configurations, and rule requests outside the initial deployment scope of work will be documented and approved using the Requirement Tracker in OneVizion.

Requirements may be added by either the Customer or OneVizion.

Requirements will be updated continuously and reviewed weekly during a change management meeting.

Each requirement will be categorized as In-Scope or Out of Scope.

In-Scope items will be worked using best efforts to meet launch targets and expectations.

Out of Scope items will be reviewed by OneVizion. More information may be needed to complete the estimate, or the request may not be possible.

Once accepted, OneVizion will provide a level of effort to be drawn against the managed services budget, and an estimated delivery date for testing.

The complexity of the request and any subsequent changes submitted by the Customer may increase the effort and time to deliver the requirement.
